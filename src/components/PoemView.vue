        <p class="text poem">
            I was born on September 13th; that makes me a Virgo.
            Honest, intelligent, hardworking, and reliable,
            are all traits I try to associate with myself.
            Perfectionist, judgemental, and analytical,
            are ones I don’t want to.
            I’m the youngest of three sisters, and my whole family.
            I have a fear of vomiting because I can’t control it,
            and I’m scared of what people would think of me,
            and I’m afraid of spiders because they have too many legs,
            and they look creepy when they walk.
            <br />
            <br />
            My favorite color is purple, but not just plain purple.
            Purple like the wisteria flowers that grow every spring,
            purple like my best friend’s graceful laugh,
            purple like the taste of smooth ice cream when I share it with my mom.
            Not just plain purple.
            <br />
            <br />
            I love the promise of friendship,
            but I’m too scared they’re crossing their fingers behind their backs.
            I love chocolate because it’s velvety and melts in your mouth.
            I’ve always wanted to travel the world, but I miss home the more I do.
            Sometimes I think it’s because I want to escape from normal,
            but I don’t like change.
            I want to see different things from my everyday life,
            but “ordinary” is my cornerstone, the sun I orbit.
            <br />
            <br />
            I love to sing and dance and act, but I can’t stand public speaking.
            I love to put on a show for others, but not if it draws too much attention.
            I loathe when people are rude, but I can always justify it for them.
            I always read because it’s another way to travel without leaving home,
            but sometimes I find myself trying to read between the lines where there’s nothing special,
            so I write when reading becomes too out of control
            and I can fix it.
            <br />
            <br />
            I always feel like I’m out of time,
            constantly chasing it while it slips away around a corner,
            or taunts me from the future I have yet to live.
            It’s always walking just a few steps ahead of me, but I can never catch up.
            Often it looks back and gives me a little wave,
            and sometimes it even holds my hand with a reassuring smile,
            but only for a moment before it
            runs off,
            again. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Hi, my name is Kalindi.
            It means “sun” in Sanskrit, but it’s strange in English.
            I always wondered about being named 
            Katherine, or Kate, or Kaylin, or Kendall,
            but everyone loves my beautiful name.
            Just, sometimes it’s hard to say.
