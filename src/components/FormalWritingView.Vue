            <b class="title text">Trust and Disguise: a Theme and Motif Exploration of <span class="italics">Six of Crows</span> by Leigh Bardugo</b>
            <br/>
            <p class="text">Trust is a complicated concept. Everyone needs time, friendship, and bonds before they can finally form it. Even the strongest relationships can be built off lies and deceit because the truth is so much harder but infinitely more important. Trust can make or break connections, form strong chains, and cause people to confide in one another. Although bonds of trust are often secure and solid, they are easily damaged or tricked. How does one know who they can trust? Is it possible to be fooled so easily? This is a theme in the book <span class="italics">Six of Crows</span>, by Leigh Bardugo, along with the recurring motif of disguise and deception. The story intertwines and relates the two topics in an exciting tale about 6 thieves, who aren’t just what they seem on the surface. <span class="italics">Six of Crows</span> uses the motif of disguise to emphasize three main ideas about trust: it can easily be tricked, once broken it is hard to mend, and it takes effort to give and receive trust. </p>
                <p class="text">From the start of the book, it is apparent that one of the main characters, Kaz Brekker, is a stubbornly closed-off person, unwilling to confide in anyone, even those in the group he works with who are under his protection. The second chapter highlights that “Kaz Brekker didn’t need a reason” (Bardugo 15) for anything suspicious he did; it’s simply known that he won’t tell. Despite his constant reclusive nature towards anyone he knows, he always expects the opposite from them. He wants to know everything about everyone because it gives him something to use so they’ll do what he wants when he asks, however, it is evident that he isn’t a trustworthy person because he often uses it against others to get what he wants. “Every favor came with enough strings attached to stage a puppet show” (Bardugo 15). Although this is true, the characters often feel drawn to tell him the truth and to trust him. Because he can seem very kind, people confide in him to later regret it when he turns on them. This shows how easily trust can be cheated by a false pretense and coerced out of someone with a smile and the right words. </p>
                    <p class="text">Trust is fragile and needs to be handled very carefully, because once broken, it’s hard to repair. Leigh Bardugo emphasizes this in <span class="italics">Six of Crows</span>. For instance, Nina and Matthias have a very complex relationship, especially when it comes to certainty in each other. Nina is called a “Grisha”, which is the equivalent of a witch. Matthias, though, is a witch hunter and very much against the whole idea of magic; he finds it very unnatural, particularly when Nina changes appearances with it, as shown by this quote: “The thought of Nina altering his appearance with her witchcraft was intolerable” (Bardugo 214). It’s clear that Matthias and Nina had crossed paths in the past, and that somehow they grew apart because one betrayed the other. This is detrimental to their friendship because their faith in each other is already so feeble, and it isn’t even fully restored by the end of the book, as Nina “could never forget Mathias’ face … how cruel he’d seemed, or the doubt that has sprung up in her heart” (Bardugo 389). She had been tormented by him before, and it was something that was hard to get over. Nina and Matthias’s scenario is a perfect example of the breaking point of trust, and how hard it is to gain again.</p>
                        <p class="text">During <span class="italics">Six of Crows</span>, all the main characters struggle with the assurance that their friends won’t betray them; most of them are thieves, which is a good reason to be skeptical of each other. The problem is that it keeps them from having good and stable friendships. “I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all” (Bardugo 434). Inej, a friend of Kaz’s says this late in the story, after they have achieved their goal, and he still won’t trust her. She is saying that she’s willing to be with him, but only if he’s willing to let down his defenses around her. He’s unable to let go of his insecurities enough to be open with her, and instead, he hides them behind a pair of leather gloves he never takes off. In order for them to overcome the obstacles in their friendship, they have to put in the effort to believe that the other won’t hurt them. Inej even urges Kaz to try, thinking to herself “Give me a reason to stay” (Bardugo 434), but he won’t, and because of this, Inej chooses to leave rather than stay. This shows the importance of both people in a trusting relationship. It won’t work out if it’s one-sided; only one of the people willing to put in the effort it takes.</p>
                            <p class="text">Trust is something so precarious that a lot of people choose to ignore or neglect it. This can cause problems, though, because it is something that needs to be nurtured in order to form strong relationships with others. Though it can be deceived easily, it is extremely hard to mend if it is broken. Trust is not something to be messed with or taken for granted; it is something to care for and protect, even if it takes a little work to do.</p>
