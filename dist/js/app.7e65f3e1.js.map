She turned away from the bin before her self-control failed and she took the letter back out. She walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Her green eyes were noticeably red, and her face had its summer tan but was blotchy, so she tied her short blonde hair back and splashed some water on her face, rinsing away her distress. She left the bathroom, waved goodbye to her mom, and walked out the door. \r\n        It took everything in her not to tell her family she had been accepted. Her parents had already paid for her first college. She needed to take care of herself. She didn’t want them to spend money they didn’t have on her. Liv swung her bag off her shoulder as she opened the car door and sat in the driver's seat. She took out her phone to text Piper that she was on her way and rolled out of the driveway. Piper Morsen was the only child of Liv’s current patient, Walter Morsen. Piper’s husband was Mike Correy, but Mr. Morsen didn’t want his family name to fade out. He convinced Piper to keep her last name so the Morsen family could at least survive one more generation. \r\n        Mr. Morsen’s nurse was busy that week and couldn’t care for him while Piper and her husband went on a short trip, so they called Liv, the physical therapist, instead. She usually only visited once a week to keep him up and moving, but this time she would be spending five whole days with him. Liv pulled up to Piper’s house and saw her waving on the porch. Mr. Morsen used to live in a mansion closer to Liv’s house called Winter Garden House but recently moved out so Piper could take care of him in a one-story house. The house was a lavender color, surrounded by trees and flower beds with bright tulips sprouting from the dirt. Piper did all the gardening herself and definitely had a green thumb. Her plants were beautiful and they thrived through each season. The house had white shutters, a balcony with potted ferns hanging from it, and a rocking chair seated below on the porch. The whole place had a weathered feeling to it, but that didn’t affect its appearance. It felt like an old house because it was one, but it didn’t look like one.\r\n        “I don’t know what I’d do without you!” Piper said as Liv approached and hugged her. “Thank you so much.” Piper had straight dark brown hair cut at her shoulders and bright blue eyes she had inherited from her dad, and was wearing a wide-brim hat and sunglasses. She had on a flowy light blue sundress and white sandals.\r\n        “Of course, it’s not a problem at all.” Liv was actually very thankful, she needed the money and liked Mr. Morsen. He was old but nice, even though he didn’t talk very much to her. Sometimes he could surprise her with a witty joke or tell her memory when he didn’t forget her name. It didn’t bother Liv because he always knew who she was, just sometimes not her name.\r\n        “Well, we’re heading out just now. Dad’s awake, so you can do whatever with him until bedtime. We’ll be back on Tuesday. The key is under that garden gnome,” she lifted her hand and pointed to a gnome with a red polka dot hat, green clothes, and dark staring gray eyes. “Dad’s meds are sorted by day on the island. We give them to him at eight in the morning and evening and the blue one with lunch. There are more written thorough instructions with them, and there’s food and snacks in the fridge and pantry if you ever get hungry. Sounds good?” Liv nodded and gave a thumbs-up. “Okay, thank you so much! I’ll see you Tuesday. Bye!” Piper got into her car and waved goodbye as her husband drove off. Liv walked to the gnome, tilted it over, picked up the silver key underneath, and slipped it onto the chain with her car key. Beside the key was a twenty-dollar bill covered in dirt. It was strange, but Liv brought it with her anyway as she entered the house. Maybe someone had accidentally dropped it there? Or maybe it was for her? She didn’t know, but she decided to keep it safe for whoever it did belong to.\r\n        “Mr. Morsen?” She called into the house. The interior was very lived-in. There were photos from Piper and Mike’s wedding, plants in every window, paintings, and antiques. The antiques probably belonged to Mr. Morsen; he had a bunch in his old house.\r\n        “Who’s there?” A voice answered coming from the living room. Liv followed it and the familiar path to the living room and found him dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and khaki pants, his white hair sticking up every which way, seated on the sofa with a puzzle in front of him.\r\n        “It’s me, Liv. I’m here to care for you while Piper and Mike are out of town.”\r\n        “Yes, of course,” he muttered as he returned to solving the puzzle. Liv approached the table, grabbed a pillow with sunflowers all over it, and kneeled on the other side. It took her a minute to adjust so she felt comfortable on the cushion, it was a bit lumpy.\r\n        “Can I help you solve it?” She asked, and Mr. Morsen gave a short nod. She began sorting all the edge pieces into a pile while he fit them together. They worked like this for an hour before the phone rang. Liv got up to answer it and was surprised to hear Piper’s voice on the other end.\r\n        “Hi, Liv?” Her voice said, sounding distant.\r\n        “Yes, it’s me. Are you still in the car?” Liv fiddled with the phone cord as she listened.\r\n        “Yeah, sorry if it’s loud. I just forgot to tell you that the house cleaner is coming on Sunday. She has her own key and everything, I just didn’t want her to scare you. She’ll be there around ten and she shouldn’t take too long. I usually go on a walk with Dad around then, so feel free to. His wheelchair is in the closet by the front door, but sometimes he’s too stubborn to use it, so just be careful if he chooses to use his walker instead. That’s all, sorry I forgot to tell you before.”\r\n        “It’s alright. Thanks for letting me know.” They said their goodbyes and hung up, and Liv returned to her seat on the floor, swapping her pillow for a different one with roses. “Do you want to watch a movie or something while we finish the puzzle?” Mr. Morsen grabbed the remote and chose a channel. It was playing a show that Liv had never seen before, but it slightly interested her. They spent the whole afternoon watching the show and solving the puzzle, only stopping to eat lunch, sandwiches. Eventually, the sun set it got late and dark, and Liv prepared dinner, a leftover lasagna Piper had made the night before. She heated it in the oven and served it on two plates for them. They ate at the dining table, the only sound the clattering of silverware against their plates. When they finished, Mr. Morsen let out a great yawn.\r\n        “Ready for bed?” Liv questioned as she took their dishes to the sink and washed them.\r\n        “Yes,” Mr. Morsen responded. Liv helped him stand and walked him to his bedroom where he brushed his teeth, and changed into his pajamas. She gave him his nighttime pills and laid him in bed.\r\n        “Goodnight Mr. Morsen,” She whispered as she turned out the light, shut the door, went to the guest bedroom, got in her own bed, and fell asleep.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        The next morning Liv woke up to a sound from the room next to her. She checked the time on her phone, it was before seven, which was when she had set her alarm for. She got out of bed and walked into the living room.\r\n        “Mr. Morsen, is everything alright?” she asked cautiously. He ignored her as he fervidly searched the room, tilting over plant pots, looking under the couch, in the cushions, behind the TV, in every cabinet. “What are you doing? Can I help?” Liv tried to stop him before he made an even bigger mess, but it was no use. He had already torn apart the whole room and was still searching. Eventually, he moved to the kitchen and began opening the drawers and cabinets in there. Liv stepped beside him and closed the door of the cabinet he was looking inside of, and finally got his attention. “What are you looking for? Please, tell me so I can help you.” Liv was starting to get a little freaked out, but she didn’t want it to show.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “It’s nothing,” Mr. Morsen said and he slowly walked back to the couch and began bending down to pick up the pillows.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “No, no. I’ll get them.” Liv rushed over, not wanting him to hurt himself. They spent the rest of the day finishing the puzzle and playing some card games. There was no more searching and no more problems. Mr. Morsen didn’t bring it up, and neither did Liv, but it was bizarre. They acted like nothing had happened, but Liv wasn’t so lucky the next day.\r\n        <br />\r\n        Sunday morning, Liv woke up to find the dining room a mess, Mr. Morsen the cause of it all. She followed behind him and cleaned up the mess. There was no puzzle-solving or games in the morning. There wasn’t even any TV watching. Mr. Morsen seemed paranoid, and it didn’t help when the house cleaner arrived at ten. He spent the two hours she was there watching her like a hawk. She wasn’t bothered by it, Liv made sure to ask, but it wasn’t something Liv was comfortable with. She tried to distract him, but he wouldn’t break. Once the cleaning lady left, it was back to normal. They finished the puzzle and played more games. The rest of the time Liv spent with Mr. Morsen was like this. One minute he was panicked and the next he was calm as could be, acting like nothing had happened. Liv believed his meds were starting to fail, but she wanted to wait for Piper’s return to get new ones, or to speak to a doctor. If it got worse, she’d have to do it anyway, before Piper got home. On Tuesday morning, the day Piper was supposed to arrive, Liv woke up to her alarm at seven, walked into the living room, and found it empty. She let out a sigh of relief, knocked on Mr. Morsen’s door, and opened it when there was no answer. Sure enough, he was fast asleep in his bed. Liv quietly closed the door, deciding he needed the sleep. At around seven-thirty, she heard Mr. Morsen wake up and come out of his room. They ate breakfast, watched TV, and played more games.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “I want it back,” he stated while they were sitting together on the front porch, the sun still low in the sky, and a slight breeze blowing past.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “What?” But, Mr. Morsen said nothing else, he just went back to watching the kids across the street playing basketball, slowly rocking back and forth in his chair. Liv didn’t press further, and she didn’t have time to because Piper’s car pulled into the driveway, she stepped out and ran up the steps to give her dad an eager hug. Liv wasn’t left out, Piper hugged them both, all the time thanking Liv.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “How was your trip?” Liv was curious, but she was also anxious to tell Piper the strange things that happened while she was gone.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Oh, it was wonderful. We went to the beach and stayed in a very fancy house, it was all so tranquil. How’d it go with Dad?”\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Well,” Liv started, but Piper interrupted.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Actually, why don’t you stay for lunch? We can talk while we eat, I’m ravenous!” Liv agreed, even though her topic wasn’t a very family-lunch-type conversation. She helped Piper prepare the food while Mike made a quick trip to the grocery store. They ate a very full meal and Piper chatted about her vacation with Mike, but Liv was too busy thinking of how to best bring up the problems that had occurred while she was gone. After finishing their dinner, they ate a complete pie and Liv finally got Piper to talk to her outside. Liv almost dragged her onto the porch and slammed the door behind them.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Piper, you need to listen to me.” Her voice sounded more urgent than she intended, but it was an urgent matter.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Is something wrong? Liv, you-” but Piper didn’t get to finish her sentence.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Yes, something is wrong, it’s your father. When you were gone, he started worrying me. There were a couple of days when he was constantly searching for… something. I don’t know what, but he told me he wanted it back and…” Liv lowered her voice, “I’m afraid his dementia has gotten worse.”\r\n        Piper looked around like someone was listening in, but when she answered her voice was as calm as ever. “Dad has a habit of hiding money around the house, paranoid after he retired from his CEO job that he’d lose all his money.” She chuckled softly to herself but immediately covered her mouth. “Sorry, that’s inappropriate. It’s just that he does it even more around the holidays, and Mike starts calling him Scrooge. Dad quickly forgets he hid the money at all. By the time he does finally remember, the maid has come by and cleaned all the money up and put it back in his room. He’s never searched for it for too long, but if he persists as you say, I’ll do something about it.” A warm breeze rustled the leaves on the trees around the house and the plants hanging from the roof of the porch swayed. A single bill elegantly fluttered out one of the pots and Piper reached out to catch it. It was a fifty; she handed it to Liv.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “No, I can’t-” Liv started.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “Consider it your tip,” Piper said brightly as she walked into the house. “I’ll write you a check for the rest, thank you so much!” Liv followed her in and grabbed her stuff, knowing she should probably leave. The topic she had brought up had dimmed Piper’s mood, and it was obvious she didn’t want to talk about it anymore.\r\n        <br />\r\n        “I’ll see you later,” she swung the door shut behind her and walked down the porch steps. The afternoon sun was in her eyes, so Liv didn’t see the garden gnome right in front of her. She stubbed her toe fell over and so did the statue, but neither of them was injured at all. Liv picked up the gnome, its eyes were still unblinkingly terrifying, the unnerving stormy gray color of stone, constantly watching her. She shivered and took the house key off the hook on her car keys. She had almost forgotten.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Liv arrived at Winter Garden House a week after her lunch with Mr. Morsen, Piper, and Mike. She had received a call from a tearful Piper telling her they had to send her dad to the local nursing home. They could all still visit him, but it wouldn’t be the same as having him home and seeing him every day. Liv had just lost her only customer, her only job; it was a blow to her income, but she wasn’t worried about that right now.\r\n        She stepped out of her car and stood in front of the towering house with white columns, perfectly cut hedges, stained glass windows, and lion statues frozen on either side of the door. Golden doorknobs and knockers gleamed in the sunlight behind Liv, the letters W.G. emblazoned below them in fancy script. All the windows sparkled and reflected the bright blue sky and cottony clouds. Through a wrought iron gate beside the house, Liv could see a crystal clear pool with fountains and cherub statues; a rippling version of Winter Garden House shone on the water. It was all so perfect, and she swore to herself the entirety of it would someday be her own; she would live there until she was old, just like Mr. Morsen. \r\n        She left the mansion and arrived home within ten minutes. She had lost her job, but she hadn’t lost hope. She walked to the recycling bin in the corner of the room and reached in, but the paper wasn’t there, and that was fine. She calmly walked to her room, started her computer, opened her email from Duke, and clicked through the link to a Duke University website. She filled out a form about her decision, including financial information. It felt surreal for her to type out her own name on the screen, and to know she was finally living her dream. When she finished the form, she let out a sigh of relief, closed her eyes, and leaned back in her chair. She could feel the fifty dollars from Piper like a lead weight in her pocket. She chuckled to herself, “Thank you Mr. Morsen!” feeling hysterical. She was going to college.        \r\n        </p>\r\n        <div class=\"vines-wrapper\">\r\n            <img class=\"vines\" src=\"@/assets/vines.jpg\" />\r\n            <img class=\"vines\" src=\"@/assets/vines.jpg\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n    name: \"CreativeWritingView\"\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n.creative-wrapper {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    max-height: calc(100% - 60px);\r\n    position: fixed;\r\n    top: 60px;\r\n    left: 0px;\r\n    background-color: white;\r\n    overflow-y: auto;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    overflow-x: hidden;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.vines-wrapper {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0px;\r\n    left: 0px;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    justify-content: space-between;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.vines {\r\n    transform-origin: 50% 50%;\r\n    transform: rotate(90deg) scale(.5 10);\r\n    opacity: .8;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.vines:nth-child(1) {\r\n    margin-left: -190px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.vines:nth-child(2) {\r\n    margin-right: -190px;\r\n    transform: scaleX(-1);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text {\r\n    font-size: 30px;\r\n    margin: 70px;\r\n    color: #585858;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    flex-direction: column;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.creativewritingheader {\r\n    color: #585858;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.creative-wrapper h1 {\r\n    margin-top: 60px;\r\n    margin-bottom: -30px;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import { render } from \"./CreativeWritingView.vue?vue&type=template&id=60aae97a\"\nimport script from \"./CreativeWritingView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./CreativeWritingView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./CreativeWritingView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=60aae97a&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","<template>\r\n    <div class=\"creative-wrapper\">\r\n        <h1 class=\"formalwritingheader\"> Formal Writing </h1>\r\n        <p class=\"text\">\r\n            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

class=\"creative-wrapper\">\r\n        <h1 class=\"poemheader\"> Poetry </h1>\r\n        <p class=\"text\">\r\n            I was born on September 13th; that makes me a Virgo.\r\n            Honest, intelligent, hardworking, and reliable,\r\n            are all traits I try to associate with myself.\r\n            Perfectionist, judgemental, and analytical,\r\n            are ones I don’t want to.\r\n            I’m the youngest of three sisters, and my whole family.\r\n            I have a fear of vomiting because I can’t control it,\r\n            and I’m scared of what people would think of me,\r\n            and I’m afraid of spiders because they have too many legs,\r\n            and they look creepy when they walk.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            My favorite color is purple, but not just plain purple.\r\n            Purple like the wisteria flowers that grow every spring,\r\n            purple like my best friend’s graceful laugh,\r\n            purple like the taste of smooth ice cream when I share it with my mom.\r\n            Not just plain purple.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            I love the promise of friendship,\r\n            but I’m too scared they’re crossing their fingers behind their backs.\r\n            I love chocolate because it’s velvety and melts in your mouth.\r\n            I’ve always wanted to travel the world, but I miss home the more I do.\r\n            Sometimes I think it’s because I want to escape from normal,\r\n            but I don’t like change.\r\n            I want to see different things from my everyday life,\r\n            but “ordinary” is my cornerstone, the sun I orbit.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            I love to sing and dance and act, but I can’t stand public speaking.\r\n            I love to put on a show for others, but not if it draws too much attention.\r\n            I loathe when people are rude, but I can always justify it for them.\r\n            I always read because it’s another way to travel without leaving home,\r\n            but sometimes I find myself trying to read between the lines where there’s nothing special,\r\n            so I write when reading becomes too out of control\r\n            and I can fix it.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            I always feel like I’m out of time,\r\n            constantly chasing it while it slips away around a corner,\r\n            or taunts me from the future I have yet to live.\r\n            It’s always walking just a few steps ahead of me, but I can never catch up.\r\n            Often it looks back and gives me a little wave,\r\n            and sometimes it even holds my hand with a reassuring smile,\r\n            but only for a moment before it\r\n            runs off,\r\n            again. \r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Hi, my name is Kalindi.\r\n            It means “sun” in Sanskrit, but it’s strange in English.\r\n            I always wondered about being named \r\n            Katherine, or Kate, or Kaylin, or Kendall,\r\n            but everyone loves my beautiful name.\r\n            Just, sometimes it’s hard to say.\r\n               \r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"vines-wrapper\">\r\n            <img class=\"vines\" src=\"@/assets/vines.jpg\"
